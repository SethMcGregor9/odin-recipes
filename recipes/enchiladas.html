<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My all-time favorite chicken enchilada recipe! See notes above for possible ingredient variations.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>2 tablespoons avocado oil (or olive oil)
        1 small white onion, peeled and diced
        1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into small 1/2-inch pieces
        1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles
        sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper
        1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
        8 large flour tortillas
        3 cups Mexican-blend shredded cheese
        1 batch red enchilada sauce
        optional toppings: fresh cilantro, chopped red onions, diced avocado, sour cream, and/or crumbled cotija cheese</p>
<h3>Directions</h3>

<h4>Step 1:</h4>
<p>Prep oven and enchilada sauce. Preheat oven to 350°F.  Prepare your enchilada sauce.</p>

<h4>Step 2:</h4>
<p>Sauté the filling mixture. In large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add diced chicken and green chiles, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.  Sauté the mixture for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through.  Add in the beans and stir until evenly combined.  Remove pan from heat and set aside.</p>
<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<p> Assemble the enchiladas. To assemble the enchiladas, set up an assembly line including: tortillas, enchilada sauce, chicken mixture, and cheese. Lay out a tortilla, and spread two tablespoons of sauce over the surface of the tortilla.  Add a generous spoonful of the chicken mixture in a line down the center of the tortilla, then sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Roll up tortilla and place in a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Assemble the remaining enchiladas.  Then spread any remaining sauce evenly over the top of the enchiladas, followed by any extra cheese.</p>

<h4>Step 4:</h4>
<p>Bake. Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, until the enchiladas are cooked through and the tortillas are slightly crispy on the outside.  Transfer the baking dish to a wire baking rack.</p>

<h4>Step 5:</h4>
<p>Serve. Serve the enchiladas immediately while they’re nice and hot and melty, garnished with lots of fresh toppings. Enjoy! </p>
